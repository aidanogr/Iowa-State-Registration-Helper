# Iowa State Registration Helper

**Iowa State Registration Helper** is a mobile app built with **Codename One** to make course registration at Iowa State University faster and easier. The tool helps students view all available schedules for given classes.

This project is not yet available in the App Store or Google Play, but it soon will be once reasonably tested and refactored.

## Current bugs and TODOs
-"BikeLock" algorithm to find next non conflicting course section is very slow (O(n^m)), a lower complexity algorithm would be nice (or even just less overhead on the current algorithm, which is Action based)

-Unit tests are missing on just about everything

-Missing features list:

 * Ability to save schedules (and output sections as txt file)

 * Notification for when there are no schedules for the current classes

 * Ability to remove a course section from the data structure entirely (should be easy but...)

 * The "Toolbar" in the calendar view should probably be a nav bar so we have a place to put these features

 * Ability to add a new class in the list
